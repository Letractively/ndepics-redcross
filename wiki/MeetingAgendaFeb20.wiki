=EPICS Meeting Minutes Feb 20, 2012=

===1) (10 min) Subversion recap and troubleshooting===
  * Able to do some testing with the PHP, hope to work with the database this coming week
  * Getting up to speed with SVN
     * Henry's email outlines svn usage for unix (ubuntu or mac)

===2) (15 min) Database Requirements for the Red Cross===
-*Are any changes necessary?*

  * The amount of search options is verbose, maybe we should combine the various searches into the general search
    * Maybe combine them into "general" and "detailed" search

  * In the "Add organization page"
    * Add Fulton county to red cross units
    * Is the "initials" option at the bottom necessary?
    * A space for the NSS ID/Code (8 character alphanum code)

-*New Functionality?*

 * Search nearby function, by address or zipcode etc.
    * Either by distance or number
    * Using the Google API, *Matt*

-*Other thoughts*

  * Interns will upload the data and parse through to check correct records
     * For example, there is a listing for bean inc from florida? (a test record that needs to be deleted)
     * Tech support on our end might be required to "train" the interns

===3) (15 min) PHP and database high-level talk===
-*Systematic way of checking for bugs?*

  * When are we ready to go "beta"?
