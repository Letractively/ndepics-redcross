New Project (Haiti): 
Give out 100 Android based smart phones.  The recipients of these apps are then obligated to fill out a survey on buildings and take pictures of the outside walls.  Pictures are saved to phone until they can be synced to database.  Based on the survey and pictures, we are supposed to be able to come up with the floor plans of the house.  The goal is to find easy tricks to making houses and other buildings in Haiti more earthquake resistant.
-special case scenarios for conditions like mold.
-identify the most at risk buildings
-grad students will make the app for a course project. undergraduate students are to make the database
-goal for this semester is to get text and photo from the phone to the database
-we will be working with the Notre Dame Haiti Project

-upgrade paper
-catch the data from the app
-scout out a new project (Madey visit from the CRC next week)
