== Desired Searches ==
 # General overall search 
 # By organization name 
 # By person's name
 # By ZIP code / city (remove state from detailed search)

== Suggested Changes for this Site ==
 * Make the input fields longer (ex. Organization name)
 * Additional Fields
   ** 24 hour contact # for organizations
   ** Additional Information field in Person table (to be used for Ham Radio Certification # for example)
 * If you create a new resource in the "Add organization" process, link back to organization input page after you add the resource

== Future Additions ==
 * Create excel spreadsheet templates for easy batch additions to the database.
 * Ability to send emails to organizations/people to verify the information in the database
 * Export csv file to be used for printing mailing labels.
 * While in the field, send notification via email/phone/text to certain people. (Not sure if this is something we want to use this site for)
