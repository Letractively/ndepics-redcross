=Meeting Minutes March 5=

===Red Cross Damage Assess Application===
 * Matt M. App Demo (Android)
  * Skeleton/fields are all in place
  * Does everything other than actually save fields/image to a database
   * RedCross suggests to limit input to yes/no on specific fields
  * Matt believes there is a simpler way to do the uploading/database work
   * Possibly POST/similar functions within Android library to do this
  * The looks (colors, buttons, etc) should be very similar between the two apps.
  * Will need to ask testers for this app that have their own android tablet/phone, etc. 
   * 5 Testers each (5 for android, 5 for iPhone)
    * Must send APK to each tester, open the e-mail on respective phone/tablet and installs on said phone/tablet

 * Cedric App Demo (Apple)
  * Has the 'flowchart' of app "Story Board" layout
   * The buttons are connected (to some degree)
   * From RedCross: don't use term "surveyors"--volunteers would be preferable
  * Cedric hopes to be at least where Matt M currently is by week after Spring Break


===Database Demo===
 * Andy, Henry, Matt D, John, Chas
  * It is ready for testing by interns!
  * Next meeting (March 19) will be database team only  


==Goals for Post-Spring Break==
 * Next meeting (March 19) will be database team only with select members from Red Cross
