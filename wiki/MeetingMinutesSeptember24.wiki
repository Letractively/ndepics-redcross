Meeting minutes for the meeting on September 24.


= Details =
Last meeting we learned that Red Cross had orders not to innovate, meaning that our work with them is terminated.
We will take the code that we have and try to apply it to the Haiti project -> need to database structural damage left over from the earthquake.
We need to look at what project we want to focus on now. Best if it is something that is interesting to us.

Places to look for projects:
   *iCenter for Social Concerns
   *iClubs/groups around campus that we know of that could use computer scientists to help with a project

W3schools.com -> sophomores should look at it to look at web development

For next meeting: brainstorm projects for our next meeting

We want to finish up the paper from the Red Cross project despite being off the database project.
   *iIt may have already been sent for submission. If they send it back, we need to edit/change it before we resubmit it

We decided to schedule the meeting for two Mondays from today. We don't have much to work on until we have a list of possible projects to go over. We will spend these next 2 weeks looking for projects.
