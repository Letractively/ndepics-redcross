# Meeting Minutes December 3 #

Demonstration
  * Photos work!
  * App demonstration was a success
  * Spoke with Professor Taflanidis
  * Don't hesitate to contact him: a.taflanidis@nd.edu

What are we doing and why?
  * Trying to get Haiti to build a different way
  * In the US we have codes
  * In Haiti, there are not enough engineers to do evaluations.
  * Now, we want to get non technical people to be able to do the same survey as trained professionals
  * That way, we can do evaluations here, and send back the information without needing localized professionals
  * Hopefully, we can convince them to change their building practices
  * 300,000 lives lost in 30 seconds. 99.99% was caused by poor construction
  * They were doing what they could afford to do, can we convince them to change?
  * 99% of the buildings on Haiti are built with practices you would never see in our country
  * Our mission is to convince them to rebuild in a different way
  * So when the next earthquake arrives, there will not be nearly as much devastation
